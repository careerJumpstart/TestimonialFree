# Introduction

TestimonialFree is an open-source testimonial web application designed to make it easy for developers to create and manage testimonials on their website. This project aims to provide web developers with a team environment to make web applications and confidently discuss this project in their interviews for their next job/promotion.

The purpose of this development plan is to outline the project scope, objectives, and milestones. It will serve as a guide for the team and provide a clear plan of action, timelines, and team structure to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.

The project scope includes the development of a user-friendly web application that allows users to create an account, log in, submit, edit, and delete testimonials, list testimonials, and create embed code to display testimonials on other websites. The project also includes the implementation of user roles, such as Super Administrator, People who want to receive testimonials, and People who want to submit testimonials. Additionally, the project will include the use of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for styling.

## The objectives of this project are to:

- Build a user-friendly web application that makes it easy for developers to create and manage testimonials on their website.
